# Lazy Logger

Simple logging wrapper for client-side to display console.log, console.warn and console.error messages in the page body (reduce need to have the console open).

Only wraps log, warn and error. Rather simplistic output (relies on toString), so you'll probably see "[object Object]" a lot. Built mainly just so I know there are messages while developing. This package will not be compiled into production.

### TODO

Probably nothing, works fine for what I use it for. PR if you want anything adding.
